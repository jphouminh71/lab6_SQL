Collaborate with: Zachary Chommala , Wayne Wood 


Write an SQL Script to create a new table to hold information on the competing universities. The table should hold the following information:

  University Name (Text) (Note: University Name should be unique and set as PRIMARY KEY)
  Date Established (Date)
  Address (Address)
  Student Population (Int)
  Acceptance Rate (Decimal)

  University Name :- CU Boulder
   Date Established :- 1876
   Address :- 1100 28th St, Boulder, CO 80303
   Student Population :- 35,000
   Acceptance Rate :- 80%
